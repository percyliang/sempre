SHRDLURN - Community & Logging Server

## Instructions

You can run the server by running ```./server.py --port <PORT_NUMBER>```

## Data Formats

We store the logs in the "DATA_FOLDER/log" path. Every user gets a file named
with their "SESSION_ID.json". Every log is composed of lines of json objects that
correspond to logged events. We append new logs to the end of every file as we
receive them.

We store the structs in the "DATA_FOLDER/structs" path. Structs are then stored
in an interior folder whose name is the SESSION_ID
of the user who submitted the struct. Within that user's folder, we store each
struct in its own file. Every struct file has as its first line a JSON array
corresponding to a list of the users who upvoted that struct. The second line
is the timestamp of when the struct was submitted. And the third line is a JSON
object of the submitted struct.

Old data from previous experiments should be moved out of the DATA_FOLDER and
into a separate time-stamped folder.

## API

server.py provides an API for the client to log actions, share structures, and
view the community's work.

A client can make the following socket requests:

    - "session": {"sessionId": SESSION_ID}
        on first connection, the client should submit a sessionId to
        be used to match all future requests. This sessionId is stored in the
        flask "request" global context variable.
    - "log": {"type": LOG_TYPE, "msg": OBJECT}
        whenever the client would like an event logged, the client can submit a
        log query and this will be logged in a file with the SESSION_ID as the
        filename.
    - "upvote": {"uid": UID, "id": ID}
        a user can upvote another user's struct by passing in the struct's
        uid and the id of the struct itself.
    - "share": {"struct": STRUCT}
        a user can share a struct and it will be saved to their directory


The server expects the client to handle the following messages when connected
to the "community" room:

    - "new_accept": {"uid": UID, "query": QUERY, "timestamp": TIMESTAMP}
        whenever a connected user accepts a new structure, we broadcast it
    - "new_define": {"uid": UID, "defined": DEFINED_TERM, "timestamp": TIMESTAMP}
        whenever a connected user defines a new query, we broadcast it
    - "upvote": {"uid": UID, "id": ID, "up": UPVOTER_ID, "score": NEW_SCORE}
        whenever a user upvotes a new struct, we broadcast the scrubbed uid
        of the new user
    - "struct": {"uid": session.uid, "id": new_struct_id, "score": score, "upvotes": [], "struct": STRUCT}
        emitted when either a new struct has been shared or on an initial load,
        when reading all the structs - this gets emitted one by one.
    - "utterances": {"uid": UID, "utterances": [UTTERANCES]}
        when a user joins the community room, we emit the latest 5 turkers'
        last 11 utterances.
